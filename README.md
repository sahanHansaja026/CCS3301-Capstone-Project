## Abstract
Bird species identification using audio signals is an effective approach for environmental education, particularly in regions with high biodiversity such as Sri Lanka. While recent machine learning techniques provide high classification accuracy, most existing systems lack explainability, making them unsuitable for child-centered learning environments.  

This research aims to develop an **explainable, child-friendly bird sound identification system** using audio-based machine learning methods. This repository supports the research by providing curated bird audio datasets of common Sri Lankan species.  

---

## Research Objectives
- Collect and organize bird sound recordings relevant to Sri Lanka  
- Support future audio-based machine learning experiments  
- Enable explainable AI research for educational applications  

---

## Dataset Description
The repository includes bird audio recordings collected from:
- **Xeno-canto**
- **Sri Lankan Nature Sounds Database**
- **Field recordings (Kegalle region)**  

The dataset focuses on **common Sri Lankan bird species** and is suitable for feature extraction techniques such as:
- MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)  
- Mel-spectrograms  

---

## Planned Work (Future Scope)
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction  
- CNN-based bird sound classification  
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM  
- Child-friendly mobile application development
